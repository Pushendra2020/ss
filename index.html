            <summary> How does the meal planner work? </summary>
            <p> Each diet plan selected can be customised according to things such as your personal statistics, current
                physical condition, activity levels and whether you want to lose fat, stay in shape, or gain muscle. It
                can be personalised to whether you are a vegan or not, if you have any allergies such as gluten, also
                including the option for halal and kosher recipes only. You can even tell the planner that you prefer to
                only drink smoothies in the morning. Once your diet plan is set up, the meal planner automatically finds
                recipes to match the diet plan criteria. Have a look at the suggested recipes that are produced for you
                automatically and adjust until you get what is right for you.
